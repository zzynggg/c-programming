Process Scheduling Simulation

~~~ Task 1 ~~~
The assumption for fisrt come, first serve is if there's a current process in
running state and a new process enter. The new process will be in ready state, 
after the current process finished execution, new process become running from ready state.
The overall idea is like queueing, which process comes first that process will prioritize
until it finished execution. 
(more details explaination will see in function header comment and in-line comment)

compile the program: gcc task-1-30885027.c -o task1
assume the other tested file is: "testingdata.txt"
assume other tested filepath is: /home/student/Documents/FIT2100/Assignment2/testingdata.txt
Make sure "task-1-30885027.c", "scheduler-result.txt", "process-data.txt" and
"testingdata.txt" is in the same directory.
The output file "scheduler-result.txt" is an empty file initially.
"testingdata.txt" the data is taken from week 6, lecture slide

~~~ Task 2 ~~~
The assumption for round robin with time-slice quantum 2 seconds is when
a new process enter and an old process becomes ready from running state, the
NEW process will prioritize. For example, an uncompleted running process will be
in ready state when it time slice quantum has reached then if there's a new process
enter then it will prioritize else the old process will continue running.

~~~ Task 3 ~~~
The assumption for earliest deadline first is when there's a current process in
running state and a new process enter. If the new process deadline is smaller
than the current running process deadline, new process with smaller deadline 
will prioritize then become running state while for current running process 
become ready from running state. The overall idea is if there's a smaller
process deadline, it will prioritize and becomes running process until another
smaller process deadline is found or the smaller process deadline finished 
execution then the next process will become running from ready state.
